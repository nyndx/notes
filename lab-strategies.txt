/ COMMON MISTAKES /
- Not reading in full sentences (don't try to speed read instructions)

/ FOLLOWUP / - good to ping all direct-connect neighbors at start
Try to locate cisco docs for:
- pppoe configuration
- ppp chap

lab strategy for configuration section:
- open notepad and save new file to desktop
- begin reading instructions
- stategize the config sections, write down overall tasks and priority at top of page
- complete layer 2
- ensure basic l3 connectivity corresponds to diagram
    ping broadcast address (255.255.255.255)
    ping in blocks
- start first section

guidelines
- one notepad file for all configs
- progressively add configs, don't do edits above unless you find a fault
    conf t
    end
- plenty of white space between device configs!
- don't copy for paste until you have the right window selected! (eve-ng)
