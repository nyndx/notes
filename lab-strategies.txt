# TODO
- What will I write down on paper when I start?
    OSPF network types
        multipoint: generate host routes due to l2 to l3 differences
        non-broadcast: unicast only
        point-to: no DR/BDR election
- Printout(s) to have present during travels, in lobby

*** IN GENERAL ***
/ OVERALL STRATEGY /
- Cherry pick, get most points possible, e.g. redistribution, ppp, etc.
- Validate to guarantee points, final read of requirements before marking done
- avoid rabbit holes, get connectivity/functionality and move on
- verify state, not configs
- consolidate work when connecting into devices when possible
- watch for broken underlays and discontiguous areas, if can't fix mend yourself
    PIM interfaces
    OSPF interfaces/areas
        use virtual-links or multi-areas unless prohibited
    LDP/MPLS interfaces
    IGP discontiguous areas with BGP 'bridges'
        bgp redistribute-internal
- MPLS filters
    vrf def and 'import-map'
    ext-community lists and rt 1:1


/ COMMON MISTAKES /
- Not reading instructions in full sentences (don't try to speed read instructions)
- access-lists for policies should cover all potential listening IPs
- verify time-range ACLs by changing clock

- requirement verbiage 'traps'
    don't configure network type on SPOKES
    must ONLY receive a default route
    should never become a transit device (stub routing)
    no TCNs are sent (portfast)
    ibgp sessions can withstand link failure (loopbacks, route reflectors)
- for ospf, where is backbone?
- care of ospf area boundaries

**** TSHOOT ****

[LEFT monitor]                  [RIGHT monitor]
diagrams       ticket window    putty screens  long notepad
                                    launch window

- Keep track of points, go for 60-80% (miss 1 4-pointer, 2 2-pointers)
- read guidelines first, that's where most restrictions are
- 5 minutes per task, extend 5 as needed, then take notes and move on
- after a solve, re-read requirements before a 'wr mem'
- line outputs
    sh term | i lines
    term mon

    sh logg | i Console logg
    logg con
    no logg con

- watch for common faults
    sh run | i policy|access
- save interesting configs to desktop for reference in config
- debug and u all as needed
    debug ip ospf adj
    debug ppp negot
    debug ip bgp updates

**** DIAG ****

[LEFT monitor]                  [RIGHT monitor]
diagrams - configs/emails       questions/answers

- 'traps'
    where is request 'received' vs where is it sent
    how many answers for question
    don't just diagnose, hone in on what's being asked
- open (and keep open) exam diagram and review
    routing protocols
    device/interface types
- email exchange
    tells problem to be resolved
- review range of possible answers
- Don't scroll so much, use links to jump to sections
- Need 2 of 3
- Keep each section under 10 mins, then move on

**** CONFIG ****
1. Prepare task paper
    Task index | locations and task numbers with code (B, EI, OS, MC, etc.)

2. Read instructions
    Tasks: ignore L2 for now
    review addressing scheme on diagram(s)
    fill out task numbers, mark verification milestones with ___ in task index

[LEFT monitor]                  [RIGHT monitor]
diagrams       task window      putty screens         long notepad
                                        launch window

4. Begin tasks

general building strategy

Network bulid task order:
- L2
    - check direct neighbor reachability (ping 255.255.255.255, in blocks)
    - cdp
    - check for switch SVIs
- IGPs IPv4
    main office(s)
    branches
- IGPs IPv6
    main office(s)
    branches
- SP peering (Internet, MetroE)
    links
    bgp
- MPLS core PE/CE
- DMVPNs
- Services
- Security

- prior to redistribution show route tables, save config!
- all redistribution config in notepad
- redistributing connected, careful of 'metric-type' and clauses

workstation
- shift+insert for paste in putty
- cascading windows
- mouse-click on putty windows bar at top, not in window
