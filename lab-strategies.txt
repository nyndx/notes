*** IN GENERAL ***
/ COMMON MISTAKES /
- Not reading instructions in full sentences (don't try to speed read instructions)
- avoid rabbit holes
- access-lists for policies should cover all potential listening IPs
- verify time-range ACLs by changing clock

- sneaky wording
    don't configure network type on SPOKES
    must ONLY receive a default route
    should never become a transit device (stub routing)
    no TCNs are sent (portfast)
    ibgp sessions can withstand link failure (loopbacks, route reflectors)
- for ospf, where is backbone?
- care of ospf area boundaries

**** DIAG ****
1. open (and keep open) exam diagram and review
    routing protocols
    device/interface types
2. email exchange
    tells problem to be resolved
3. review range of possible answers
4. Don't scroll so much, use links to jump to sections

- RIGHT monitor
    exam window
- LEFT monitor
    duplicated window to see materials (perhaps 2)


**** TSHOOT ****
Determine approximate number of points needed to pass
5 minutes per task, extend 5 as needed, then take notes and move on
Likely going to borrow time from config

- RIGHT monitor
    putty screens       window for launching terminals     long notepad (saving cfgs)
- LEFT monitor
    diagram window      ticket window

**** CONFIG ****
1. Prepare task paper
    Task index | locations and task numbers with code (B, EI, OS, MC, etc.)

2. Read instructions
    Tasks: ignore L2 for now
    review addressing scheme on diagram(s)
    fill out task numbers, mark verification milestones with ___ in task index

3. Setup screens
- RIGHT monitor
    putty screens       window for launching terminals     long notepad
- LEFT monitor
    diagram window      task window

4. Begin tasks

general building strategy

Network bulid task order:
- L2
    - check direct neighbor reachability (ping 255.255.255.255, in blocks)
    - sw to router, rely on CDP?
- service provider routes
    links
    bgp
- DMVPNs
- MPLS core PE/CE
- IGPs IPv4
    main office(s)
    branches

- prior to redistribution, save config!
- all redistribution config in notepad
- redistributing connected, careful of 'metric-type' and clauses

guidelines
- consolidate work when connecting into devices

workstation
- shift+insert for paste in putty
- cascading windows
- mouse-click on putty windows bar at top, not in window
