/ COMMON MISTAKES /
- Not reading instructions in full sentences (don't try to speed read instructions)
- avoid rabbit holes

/ FOLLOWUP / - good to ping all direct-connect neighbors at start

starting strategy
- open notepad and save new file to desktop
- begin reading instructions
- write down overall tasks and config order at top of page
- careful of terms
    must ONLY receive a default route
    should never become a transit device (stub routing)


general building strategy - L2/L3
- some may already be built!
- complete layer 2
- complete layer 3 addressing
- no shut on SVIs
- ensure basic l3 connectivity corresponds to diagram
    ping broadcast address (255.255.255.255)
    ping in blocks
- continue down build list in order

guidelines
- consolidate work when connecting into devices
