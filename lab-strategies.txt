**** TSHOOT ****
Determine approximate number of points needed to pass
5 minutes per task, extend 5 as needed, then take notes and move on
Likely going to borrow time from config

**** CONFIG ****

/ COMMON MISTAKES /
- Not reading instructions in full sentences (don't try to speed read instructions)
- avoid rabbit holes

/ STARTUP /
- on paper
    [far-left column is tasks]
    [remaining columns are sites]

- begin reading instructions
    don't worry about l2
    fill out task numbers, mark verification tasks
    check sections

- launch console to determine 'putty screen'
- align other windows, one monitor for diagram
- other monitor layout:
    putty sessions  [top left]  task lists [top right]
    notepads [bottom]

- careful of terms
    must ONLY receive a default route
    should never become a transit device (stub routing)
    no TCNs are sent (portfast)
    ibgp sessions can withstand link failure (loopbacks, route reflectors)

general building strategy - L2/L3
- some may already be built!
- complete layer 2
- check direct neighbor reachability (ping 255.255.255.255, in blocks)
- no shut on SVIs
- continue down build list in order

guidelines
- consolidate work when connecting into devices

workstation
- shift+insert for paste in putty
- cascading windows
