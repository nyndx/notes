/ COMMON MISTAKES /
- Not reading in full sentences (don't try to speed read instructions)

/ FOLLOWUP / - good to ping all direct-connect neighbors at start?
List of problematic help documents
- pppoe configuration
- ppp chap

lab strategy for configuration section:
- open notepad and save new file to desktop
- begin reading instructions
- stategize the config sections, write down overall tasks and priority at top of page
- start first section
- when referencing a diagram, take extra time to confirm located the correct router/interface/link etc.

guidelines
- one notepad file for all configs
# - add devices to file as they are being edited, not in any other order
- progressively add configs, don't do edits above unless you find a fault
- plenty of white space between device configs!
- don't copy for paste until you have the right window selected! (eve-ng)
